Programming is hard. I mean, REALLY HARD! It takes years to learn and still then,
solving "simple" problems might end up being really hard to do. GUI / Web
programming is a prime example of this. Even though it's easy to describe how
a GUI / website should look to someone else, actually implementing it requires
knowledge of several huge frameworks or even programming languages.

I really do believe that programming as of today is a lot harder than it needs
to be. I think that by improving programming languages / environments, experts
could become more productive, but more importantly, more non-experts would
be able to use them. We all own very powerful computers, but only a small
fraction of people can use the full potential of their machines.

This is the reason why I started this blog. In future posts, I'm going to take
a closer look on different problems I see in state-of-the-art programming and
my ideas on how to solve them.

*The future of programming is bright, we just need to work on it to make it happen*
